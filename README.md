# Training Evaluation Quiz
The purpose of this quiz is for Teachers/Trainers to evaluate whether the learners have a good grasp of the theory module concepts and contents that have been delivered to them previously. A link would be sent to the students for them to complete the 10 question quiz, and the name and final score is exported to a Google worksheet where the teacher can view and determine if the score is sufficient, or more training is required.
